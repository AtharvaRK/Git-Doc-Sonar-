Welcome to the Jenkins Pipeline script for Continuous Integration (CI) and SonarQube analysis! This pipeline script is designed to automate the process of checking out code, building Docker images, and running SonarQube analysis, ensuring code quality and seamless integration into your DevOps workflow.

## <font size="4">Overview</font>

This Jenkins Pipeline script is a powerful tool that streamlines the development process by automating various tasks, including:

- **Code Checkout:** Automatically fetches the latest code from your repository.
- **Docker Image Creation:** Builds Docker images from the checked-out code, facilitating easy deployment and scalability.
- **SonarQube Analysis:** Performs static code analysis using SonarQube, providing valuable insights into code quality and potential issues.
